**Anthro GHG, Aerosols, and other species**

This code script quantifies historical (1750-2022) emissions, ERF, and temperture (del_T) contributions by sector of the the following:

* GHG: Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), Nitrous Oxide (N2O), Halogenated Compounds (CFCs, HFCs, HCFCs, etc.)
* Air pollutants: NOx, VOCâ€™s, CO, SO2, NH3,
* Aerosols: Organic carbon, Black Carbon

Emissions, ERF, and del_T contributions are allocated to the following sectors:

* Power
* fossil fuel production and distribution (ffpd)
* Industry
* Transportation
* Buildings
* Waste
* Agriculture
  
Data Sources:

Initial Emissions Data Gathered from EDGAR - Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research, specifically EDGAR v8.0 https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dataset_ghg70 and EDGAR v6.1 https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dataset_ap61#sources

Final Emissions Data for major GHGs and air pollutants from Community Emissions Data Systems (CEDS) version v_2024_04_01. Emissions pre-1970 are from v_2021_04_21 fuel data with sector partitioning from latest version 1970 allocation.

HC (CFC, HCFC) emissions data from WMO Ozone 2022 Report, HFC and HCFC emission data from EDGAR - Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research, specifically EDGAR v8.0, with other species from UNEP Ozone Depleting Substance databases. HC emissions sectoral fractions calculated using UNFCCC AFEAS database and UNEP ODS. See HC Section for specific details.

Final fuel consumption data from International Energy Agency (IEA) to allocate ffpd sector emissions to other sectors
